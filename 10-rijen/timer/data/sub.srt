1
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,681
We're done!

2
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:57,201
I hope I'll make you up
for your wedding.

3
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:59,306
You first!

4
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,222
Layale, listen darling.

5
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:27,027
I have an audition
for a major ad and I'm late.

6
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:29,534
Please let me in before the redhead.

7
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:34,907
Hello, Soussou.

8
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:36,704
- How are you?
- Fine.

9
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,142
What will it be today?

10
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:41,908
Lots of volume, like a fluffy cat.

11
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,381
For Sunday.

12
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:44,643
What's on Sunday?

13
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:48,449
We might bury my sister-in-law.

14
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,457
She's dying, she won't last long.

15
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,384
But everything is ready.

16
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,120
I bought two pretty trays...

17
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,391
...for serving coffee and cigarettes.

18
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:01,434
Handmade, at a very good price.

19
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,496
And what a dress I got her!

20
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:08,108
With lace, especially around the collar.

21
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:11,143
Then I took it to the tailor...

22
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,974
...to take it in.

23
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,916
Layale, it's for you.

24
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,288
Hello.

25
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,824
Okay.

26
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,867
Okay, my love.

27
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,239
Soussou, I have to run.

28
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,503
Nisrine will look after you. Okay?

29
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:44,907
This is outrageous!

30
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,504
Nisrine, look after the shop.
I won't be long.

31
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,917
Nisrine.

32
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:15,810
- Lili. Lili, what are you doing?
- Working.

33
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,334
What?

34
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,536
What are you doing?

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,012
- I'm looking for a piece of paper.
- What paper?

36
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,343
My piece of paper.

37
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:23,916
Okay, out of the way.

38
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,479
I'll give you another one.

39
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,348
But!

40
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,960
Take this one, it's better.

41
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,420
Take it.

42
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:38,191
- I don't want it.
- It's much nicer.

43
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,427
Look how nice these are.

44
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,594
There's plenty.
Forget the other one.

45
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:47,229
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Hell, where else?

46
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,537
Go now.

47
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:33,542
Hello, Miss.

48
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,049
Hello.

49
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,622
You'd look prettier with the seatbelt on.

50
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,353
I can't, it suffocates me.

51
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,293
Truth be told, you're absolutely right.

52
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:47,561
But public safety requires it.

53
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,830
And if I don't put it on?

54
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,508
I'll have to...

55
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,269
...fine you.

56
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:00,307
As if I'm not fined enough?

57
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,712
Better now?

58
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,310
Satisfied?

59
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,581
Marvelous.

60
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:10,088
- Can I go now?
- Drive safely.

61
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,118
Thank you.

62
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,919
- What's up?
- Oh, my God!

63
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,168
Do you want a snack?

64
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:07,378
Your shirt is pretty.

65
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,915
Did she give it to you?

66
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:15,380
I won't leave until you fix my hair.

67
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,786
- What is this?
- Volume.

68
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,928
You call this volume?
Do you like it?

69
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,996
Would you go out looking like this?

70
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,495
- What's up?
- Shut them up...

71
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:30,263
...before I lose my temper
and hurt someone.

72
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:32,202
We need to close.

73
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,475
What's this pin for?

74
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,546
- It's chic.
- You consider this chic?

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,410
What's wrong?
Aren't you late for the audition?

76
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,610
My hair doesn't resemble
the haircut in the magazine.

77
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,482
Look closely at the picture.

78
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,954
Can't you see that the model
is your daughter's age?

79
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,356
Shut up and go inside.
That's enough.

80
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:56,156
What's wrong?
It's looks great.

81
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:57,958
You think this is great, Layale?

82
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,761
My hair has no volume.

83
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:04,565
See how she glued these?
I look old and cockeyed.

84
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,696
Like a femme fatale.

85
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,934
Shut your trap!

86
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,511
What does she want?
To get rid of me?

87
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:13,978
No, to be your loyal slave.

88
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,776
Will you shut up?

89
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,577
It's too hot in here.

90
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:20,186
Don't be cheap, turn on the AC.

91
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,914
The electrical fuse might blow up.

92
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,548
- Shut up.
- Switch off the fridge.

93
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,593
Forget this tape, it's useless.

94
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,321
Yeah, you're right.

95
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:33,434
Why do you insist on using it?

96
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:38,232
I'll tie your hair in a way...

97
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,806
...that will lift your eyes up
without the tape.

98
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:46,335
You'll look younger.
Then, we take off this pin.

99
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:48,948
- Look how gorgeous.
- You think so?

100
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,211
You're dazzling.
Like an orchid.

101
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,418
Rima, Johnny Bravo's here.

102
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:59,253
Thank God we're closed.

103
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,019
Hi, girls.

104
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:03,595
Hello. Good evening.

105
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:11,994
How are you, Bassam?

106
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,734
If they like your hair,
tell them I did it.

107
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,440
Good luck with the audition.

108
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,117
Rima, take care of the shop.

109
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,720
- Yeah, okay.
- Bye.

110
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:57,408
Hello, Auntie Rose.
How are you?

111
00:09:57,552 --> 00:10:00,146
- Fine, and you?
- All is well.

112
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,313
How are you, Lili?

113
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,750
I've got some aprons that need fixing.

114
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,191
Put them on the table.

115
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:10,887
Stay for coffee.
We'll have a chat.

116
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:14,263
Some other time.
I have a bus to catch.

117
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:15,959
Bye, Lili.

118
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:18,298
Lili, she's saying goodbye.

119
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,168
Bye, bye, bye.

120
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:21,775
Okay, I'm off.

121
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:24,969
Goodnight. Thank you.

122
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,240
Lili, why are you acting this way?

123
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,513
She was talking to you.

124
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,712
You want to scare the customers away?

125
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,982
What are you doing?

126
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,297
Do I look better now?

127
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,865
You'd look better
without the chewing gum.

128
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,347
Welcome, it's a great honor.
Behold our future bride.

129
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,744
It's a great pleasure.

130
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:17,255
You made us happy.
Bless you.

131
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,392
Are you mad?

132
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,087
No one can see us.

133
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,299
My God.

134
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,569
You're so handsome.

135
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,436
Let me do the dishes.

136
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,274
You've been up since this morning.

137
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,313
No, let me do it.

138
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,114
I'll do it!

139
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,527
Okay, dear?

140
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,631
How is work?
Everything is fine?

141
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,930
Hello.

142
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:05,871
Is there a problem?

143
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,530
No, everything's great.

144
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,697
Please, feel at home.

145
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,773
Thank you.

146
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,820
I cannot speak louder.

147
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:31,488
My little brother's asleep.

148
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,631
I can't go to the living room.
My parents will hear me.

149
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:46,641
Wait, I'll go to the bathroom.

150
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:56,147
Can you hear me better?

151
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,521
How many times must we talk about it?

152
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:02,254
I don't feel myself.

153
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:24,579
What's his problem?

154
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:36,923
Hello.

155
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:38,053
Hello.

156
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,427
A problem with the car?

157
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,958
No. Is there a problem?

158
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,730
The lady is your wife?

159
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,509
The lady is my fiancée.

160
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:51,770
Your fiancée.

161
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,478
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

162
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,711
We were at a party.
Now we're having a chat.

163
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:00,013
And I'm about to walk her home.

164
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,178
Why don't you chat at her place?

165
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,120
This is an indecent activity.

166
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,521
Two people talking in the street...

167
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,355
...is an indecent activity?

168
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,622
Who can prove she lives here?

169
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,390
Her parents live here.

170
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:17,334
Do you want us to go up
and check it out together?

171
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:18,870
Lower your voice.

172
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,338
Quit it, I'm talking.

173
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:22,998
Who can prove she's your fiancée?

174
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:26,670
Instead of catching criminals,
you're harassing us?

175
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:27,872
Exactly!

176
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,209
Help me, God!
He doesn't want to understand.

177
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,512
- And now what?
- Your ID.

178
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:34,677
- Give him the ID.
- No way.

179
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:38,258
Give him the ID.
Don't make a scene.

180
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,824
Never!

181
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,155
What a stubborn mule.

182
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,889
Comply, or get out of the car.

183
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,159
My God, I'm always misunderstood.

184
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:50,303
Get out of the vehicle, please.

185
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,132
I won't get out! You get in!

186
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:57,910
"The policeman having insisted...

187
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:00,910
...several times...

188
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:05,281
...that the driver..."

189
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,713
What's his name again, our "Romeo"?

190
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,017
Bassam the Bragger.

191
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:15,286
Bragger! Bragger.

192
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,767
"...to get out of the vehicle..."

193
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:24,067
What did he say?

194
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,470
"Even God won't get me out".

195
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,408
God?

196
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:40,479
"Even God won't get me out...

197
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:44,315
...of the vehicle."

198
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,222
He's one strong guy.

199
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:52,223
You know that we have enough
reasons to send you to jail?

200
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,891
That'll make your day.

201
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:05,139
<i>Oh, yes, our beautiful bride</i>

202
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,113
<i>Oh yes, Bassam is at her feet</i>

203
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,979
<i>Oh yes, for you we shall sing</i>

204
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:15,646
<i>Walk proud</i>

205
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,622
<i>Our lovely and pretty bride</i>

206
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:22,660
<i>If that night, Bassam didn 't mess up</i>

207
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,855
<i>And the police didn 't rub</i>
<i>His face in the mud</i>

208
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,693
<i>And your father didn't threaten him</i>

209
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,268
<i>Your wedding day</i>
<i>Would have never come so soon!</i>

210
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,774
<i>Walk proud, my lovely bride</i>

211
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,913
<i>The most beautiful rose</i>
<i>In the garden</i>

212
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,553
Help! Help me!

213
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:52,889
Please, help me!

214
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,625
- Please let go.
- No way!

215
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:56,752
I want them.

216
00:17:56,897 --> 00:18:00,025
Even if I must lie
in the middle of the road.

217
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,601
Go back, please. Let go.

218
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,365
I'll call a policeman.
I've had enough!

219
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:08,441
But I am the police.

220
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,177
He deserves it.

221
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,506
- Although he's cute.
- Cute? Him?

222
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,308
You never like anybody?

223
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:18,441
Enough. Without him,
we'd still be at the police station.

224
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,416
Even God wouldn't
get him out of the car.

225
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,715
These are parking tickets.
Why do you want them?

226
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:26,451
They are from my fiancé.

227
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,821
Your fiancé?

228
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,659
Come here.

229
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:32,924
My God, your grip is as powerful
as a crab's claw!

230
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,058
What's the matter, my dear Lili?

231
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,193
He's torturing me.

232
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:39,134
- What's going on?
- She's collecting tickets.

233
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:42,071
You don't want that?
That's better, isn't it?

234
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,939
- I don't want it.
- Take a flower.

235
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,569
I don't want it!

236
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,339
What is she doing?

237
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:51,345
She is stealing the tickets!

238
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:54,283
Thank you for what you did last night.

239
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,048
It's nothing.

240
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,884
If you hadn't been there...

241
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:01,620
You know, I didn't do much.

242
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:06,461
You could drop by our salon sometime.

243
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,626
- We'll give you special treatment.
- One day, I will.

244
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,430
Nisrine, come here!

245
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,233
All the girls will be at your service.

246
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,274
Goodbye. We'll be expecting you.

247
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,114
You think you're stronger
than the policeman?

248
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,453
Go inside now.

249
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:34,856
I won't.

250
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,053
Stop. I'm working.

251
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,391
Oh, really! You're working?

252
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:42,001
You do nothing but follow me.

253
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:43,592
Hello, ladies.

254
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:44,999
Hello. Welcome.

255
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,539
Don't talk to her!
Come, let me give you some love.

256
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:50,541
Go inside.

257
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:51,939
Ma'am, could you, please...

258
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,876
Go in, so I can understand.

259
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:57,814
How can you understand him?
You can't even understand me.

260
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:01,148
- He's American.
- Shut up. Let me find out what he wants.

261
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:03,950
He wants me to run away with him.

262
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:07,719
Go inside, you're embarrassing me.
I want to know what he wants.

263
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:10,887
Go play with the rubbish
you've been collecting.

264
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:14,023
Don't come out again.

265
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:19,370
There. That's the vest.

266
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,564
The jacket.

267
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:24,039
It's too big, it needs fixing.

268
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,169
- Oh, you want to fix it?
- Yes.

269
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,907
The trousers need shortening.

270
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:30,107
That's fine. Go change.

271
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,878
Alright. Go in and try it on.

272
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:36,989
- Try.
- Alright.

273
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:39,149
Thank you.

274
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:19,461
<i>My darling likes to go for a stroll</i>

275
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,100
<i>In the evening, he says</i>
<i>Let's go</i>

276
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:26,504
<i>If I say no, I'm in trouble</i>

277
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,505
<i>Welcome, my prince</i>

278
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,377
Lili, what are you doing?

279
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:33,479
You keep on sewing.

280
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,682
Sorry.

281
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,011
Good morning, sir.
How are you?

282
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:43,122
Where have you been, my love?

283
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,199
Hello, Auntie Rose.

284
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:56,797
Here are the aprons.

285
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:59,667
Come in, don't stay by the door.

286
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,673
No, I can't.
I left Lili by herself.

287
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:04,743
Don't worry about Lili.

288
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:07,277
Come in for a hairdo.
We're not busy.

289
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,406
- No, no.
- Come on in.

290
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,144
I must go, she's alone.

291
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,278
Your hair needs a good brushing.

292
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:17,720
Come on in, we're having coffee.

293
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,385
Come in, we need
to find you a husband.

294
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:22,288
You're a bit late.

295
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,954
You're still beautiful, come in.

296
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:28,465
No, Lili's all by herself. I must go.

297
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:45,407
Hello.

298
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:55,083
Sorry, I came without an appointment.
Can I get my hair done?

299
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,790
- Something's bothering you?
- Not at all.

300
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,664
I was just walking by.
I decided to come in.

301
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:13,136
I had nothing to do.

302
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,969
I'm glad that you came.

303
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,362
Go on, run.

304
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:21,866
Handsome young man.
Don't forget!

305
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:25,301
Pick up the ones under the car.

306
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:29,735
And you, sweetheart.
Pick up the two papers over there.

307
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,741
Put them in the basket.

308
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:35,644
God bless you and keep you safe.

309
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:49,083
Yes, put them in there.

310
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,495
I want to see what he wrote to me.

311
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:54,622
What?

312
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:58,033
He loves me very much.
He wrote me all these letters.

313
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,798
- Thank you, dear.
- Okay, bye.

314
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't be long!

315
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:35,441
Hello, my love.

316
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:42,879
Hello.

317
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:45,312
Hello, sunshine.

318
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:48,113
You forgot your wallet.

319
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:51,053
I was expecting your call.

320
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:53,415
What?

321
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,487
I swear, I've been waiting for an hour.

322
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,097
Ask Joseph.

323
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,898
Okay, stop fooling around.

324
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:03,434
When can you pick it up?

325
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,838
Now I'm busy.
I'm having my coffee.

326
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:12,607
And Joseph is foreseeing my future.

327
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:18,008
He sees a chair and a beautiful girl.

328
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:21,517
She's at the window.
She's looking at me without seeing me.

329
00:28:27,594 --> 00:28:28,925
I swear.

330
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:32,156
There's even a fly on my forehead.

331
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:36,125
She parks in forbidden areas...

332
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:39,830
...to tease the policeman
who's admiring her...

333
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,431
...instead of fining her.

334
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,274
You find it funny!

335
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:54,684
Okay, goodbye.

336
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:05,580
Anything else?

337
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,660
Can you sign here, please?

338
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:13,194
- Where?
- Here, please.

339
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:17,425
That's it?

340
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,233
Here also. New regulations.

341
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:23,570
- Anything else?
- Thank you.

342
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,644
Let's go.

343
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:30,582
- Can I drop you off somewhere?
- What?

344
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:34,276
- Drop you off?
- No, thanks. Don't bother.

345
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,812
Tarek, answer.

346
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:09,547
Tarek, answer!

347
00:31:12,492 --> 00:31:13,789
Hurry up, Léa.

348
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:17,857
Yes, Dad.

349
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,126
Mom?

350
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:22,926
She's not here.

351
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:24,058
I don't know.

352
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,138
Smoking a joint next door.

353
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:31,774
Stupid! Damn you!

354
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,451
What's the matter? I'm busy.

355
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,453
I'm busy in the kitchen.
What do you want?

356
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,390
What?

357
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,790
Why promise the kids...

358
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:49,417
...and then change your mind?

359
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:52,121
Good for you.
Okay, leave me alone.

360
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:53,994
Okay, goodbye.

361
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,328
What an idiot!

362
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:58,835
And you two, out of my sight!

363
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:01,133
Your father is busy.

364
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:03,834
He's taking his girlfriend to the beach.

365
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,447
Hello.

366
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,149
I want to have my hair done.

367
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,987
Of course, come in.

368
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,822
- Hello.
- Good morning. Welcome.

369
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:25,751
Start the generator,
I need to use the blow dryer.

370
00:33:35,568 --> 00:33:37,035
Sorry it took me so long.

371
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,495
It's okay.

372
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:45,868
Mr. Charles!

373
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,707
Mr. Charles, tell her to let me out.

374
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:54,309
Why are you so stubborn?

375
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:56,445
Stubborn as a mule!

376
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,985
You old bag!

377
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:01,649
In your dreams, I'll let you out!

378
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:03,318
I'm going to kill her.

379
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,869
There are people
expecting me for dinner.

380
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,665
Expecting you?

381
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:14,864
In Hell, yes.

382
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:17,033
You wait and see.

383
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,839
The plane is about to take off.
It's getting dark.

384
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,005
She wants to travel now.

385
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:25,413
I'll send you up to Heaven, alright.

386
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:28,977
I'm going to tell the neighbors.

387
00:34:30,356 --> 00:34:33,757
They'll eat you alive.

388
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:38,223
Rose!

389
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:41,958
Damn whoever gave you that name.

390
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,270
Excuse me.

391
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:49,372
Wait till I get my hands on you.

392
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:52,910
If you drive the customers away,
how will we survive? Go upstairs!

393
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:56,504
- The plane is taking off.
- What plane? Where to?

394
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:57,980
I'm expected for dinner.

395
00:34:58,117 --> 00:35:01,109
Yes, everybody's expecting you.

396
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:05,088
If you drive them away,
how will we live?

397
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:15,696
I'm sorry, sir.

398
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,333
Sorry.

399
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:24,476
Are the trousers okay?

400
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:32,381
I'd like them a little shorter, please.

401
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:35,282
- Shorter?
- Yes. I like it.

402
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:39,688
- Shorter? Like this?
- Yes.

403
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:42,556
Nice, isn't it?

404
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:48,861
Just what I needed.
Another crazy fool.

405
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:03,704
Walid.

406
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,314
Can you call me from the land line?

407
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:08,442
I'm too tired.

408
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:10,613
I need to check if my mobile is working.

409
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,691
Do as your sister says.

410
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:22,924
Okay, it's working.

411
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:36,312
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

412
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:54,395
Rabih, it's Layale.

413
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:59,101
Rabih. Can you hear me?

414
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:31,960
Layale. Layale.

415
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:33,093
Yes?

416
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,400
The fan's batteries are dead.

417
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:37,566
Do you have any?

418
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:48,217
Hello! Come in.

419
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:54,486
Look in the cup, there's a white horse!

420
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,184
Do you know what it means?

421
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,819
You'll be married soon.

422
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:00,862
Are you hiding secrets from us?

423
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,027
Hiding secrets from your mother?

424
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:05,262
You believe this nonsense, Mom?

425
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,030
Yes, of course!

426
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,905
Make a wish now.

427
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:20,247
There's a husband, look at the ring!

428
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,478
Look how it sparkles.

429
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:26,050
That's good.
She's going to get married.

430
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:27,921
That's for sure,
you're going to be happy.

431
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,119
You believe this rubbish?

432
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,091
Things she's told me have come true...

433
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,234
We'll eat cakes.

434
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:37,666
We'll rejoice.

435
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:04,484
Hi, my name's Jamale Tarabay.
I have two children.

436
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:06,748
Turn the board around.

437
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:09,052
I can't read it.

438
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,697
My name's Jamale Tarabay...

439
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,094
The light's too strong.

440
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:16,224
Nothing I can do about it.

441
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:18,360
Look into the camera.

442
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:22,971
I have two children.
I have many hobbies.

443
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:24,508
I was an actress.

444
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:27,373
- Really! What kind of roles?
- Soap operas.

445
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:28,843
You've never seen me?

446
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:30,175
Not really.

447
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:32,716
Series and ads too.

448
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:34,717
Such as?

449
00:40:35,588 --> 00:40:38,113
Products, detergents, lots of things.

450
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:41,317
Okay. Now lose the board.

451
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:45,922
Higher.

452
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:48,795
Very good. Now the other way.

453
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,562
- How?
- The other way.

454
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:53,466
Lower your arms.

455
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:57,201
Tell me about yourself. Right side.

456
00:40:57,343 --> 00:40:59,402
No. Right, darling.

457
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:01,877
Okay, tell me about yourself.

458
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,406
I have lots of hobbies.

459
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,609
I like music, painting...

460
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:08,743
Very good.

461
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:10,788
Other side now.

462
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:14,185
Other side, please.

463
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:17,925
Okay. Go on.

464
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:19,655
Sideways?

465
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:22,364
Can you walk now?

466
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:25,402
- That way?
- Please.

467
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:46,054
Are you a group?

468
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:47,659
No, just two people.

469
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:50,785
- Two girls?
- No. My husband and me.

470
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:53,796
Ah, you're married.

471
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,594
Two people.
A double bed, I guess?

472
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:01,095
- When for?
- Saturday.

473
00:42:01,273 --> 00:42:04,140
Saturday, just a minute.

474
00:42:15,154 --> 00:42:17,145
Can I have your name?

475
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:20,622
Rosette Baddour.

476
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,056
Rosette Baddour?

477
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:25,220
Pretty name, Baddour.

478
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:28,959
Are you from Beit-Méry?

479
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:30,830
I have friends from the Baddour family.

480
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,494
From Beit-Méry, yes.

481
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:34,970
Mr. Samir, the owner of the supermarket.

482
00:42:35,107 --> 00:42:38,099
Do you know him?

483
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:40,041
He's a relative.

484
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:43,910
By the way, were you living in Canada...

485
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:45,710
No.

486
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:47,375
I'm sorry.

487
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,217
I need your ID card, please.

488
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,821
Or any other ID proving that...

489
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,387
...you're married.

490
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,987
These are the regulations.

491
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:01,798
Just a second...

492
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,095
Take your time.

493
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:15,875
It's hot. Can we open the window?

494
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:19,143
No, darling. We can't. Sorry.

495
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:20,752
Let's continue.

496
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:23,787
Now face the wall.

497
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:28,184
Look straight in front of you.

498
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:31,294
Sideways.

499
00:43:32,498 --> 00:43:34,489
Now look at the wall...

500
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:37,431
...as if speaking to a friend.

501
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,364
- Recite the script.
- Like this, or towards you?

502
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:43,100
Your body still, your face towards me.

503
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:46,302
My body still and my face towards you?

504
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:48,436
Yesterday, I met my friend.

505
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:52,975
She told me, "Your face is glowing.
What's your secret?"

506
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:55,109
Sorry to interrupt...

507
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:58,489
...but there's something
stuck on your eyebrows.

508
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:03,586
I told her, " I am using
the new soap Eve."

509
00:44:04,063 --> 00:44:06,190
It has a freshening effect.

510
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:08,823
Every evening,
I wash my face with it.

511
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:16,465
Smile.

512
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:19,271
You should be happy
about your fresh complexion.

513
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:21,743
My friend congratulated
me on my complexion.

514
00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:26,279
She told me, "What do you do
to have such a radiant complexion?"

515
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,285
"I use a new soap. Eve."

516
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:31,651
It's very good in the evening.

517
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,781
It is very fresh.

518
00:44:35,027 --> 00:44:37,587
- Come on, go on.
- I can't.

519
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,170
- You'll be with whom?
- Sorry?

520
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:54,973
Who you're sharing the room with?

521
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:56,809
With my husband.

522
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:58,981
Can I have your name?

523
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,646
Liliane Chakkour.

524
00:45:09,395 --> 00:45:12,660
I need an ID card, please.

525
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,413
Hello. Good morning, Pasha.

526
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:32,881
I'm fine, thank you.

527
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:34,349
At your service.

528
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:39,818
It's okay. We'll be there in five minutes.

529
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,926
God be with you.

530
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:45,287
Good morning.

531
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,093
A morning full of roses and jasmine!

532
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,699
Any cake left?

533
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,366
My God! What's this place?

534
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:24,907
What?

535
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:26,542
Oh, my God!

536
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:35,211
- Why are you so gloomy?
- Look who's talking!

537
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:38,783
What have you done to your face?

538
00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:41,449
Just a bit of touching up.

539
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:43,356
Makeup.

540
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:50,463
Since this morning...

541
00:50:50,602 --> 00:50:52,627
...like an idiot...

542
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:55,932
...I've been cleaning
every inch of the room.

543
00:50:56,074 --> 00:50:58,167
I almost bleached the carpet.

544
00:50:59,177 --> 00:51:02,271
I even allowed myself to be taken...

545
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:04,143
...for a hooker.

546
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:06,917
And he doesn't even call.

547
00:51:08,754 --> 00:51:12,349
He just sent a message:
"Can't get away from my wife."

548
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,954
What kills me is how stupid I am.

549
00:51:17,095 --> 00:51:20,895
I spend my life waiting for a horn.

550
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:22,022
A car horn!

551
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,499
- What horn?
- Forget it.

552
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,867
Lucky he didn't show up,
the cake is terrible.

553
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,032
Let me taste.

554
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:37,882
How many eggs did you put in?

555
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,517
Ten, as you said.

556
00:51:39,684 --> 00:51:42,278
Ten? Are you out of your mind?

557
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:44,785
Disgusting.

558
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:48,990
I can't even look into my parents' eyes.

559
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:52,824
I'm so ashamed.

560
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,999
In the evening they ask:
"Where were you?"

561
00:51:57,135 --> 00:51:58,796
I say, "At the salon."

562
00:51:58,937 --> 00:52:02,805
"When are you getting married?"
What do you want me to tell them?

563
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:10,814
And I'm still lying to myself...

564
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:14,383
...thinking that he's going to leave her.

565
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:18,350
What gets to me, is not knowing...

566
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,550
...who is this woman
that he can't leave?

567
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:24,594
I want to know who she is.

568
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:26,697
What she's like.

569
00:52:26,832 --> 00:52:28,993
How she walks.

570
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:31,328
How she smells.

571
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:36,502
Do you think you are
the only one living a lie?

572
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:40,537
Nisrine?

573
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:42,840
What's the matter?

574
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,074
Honey, what's wrong?

575
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,310
What's wrong? What's wrong?

576
00:52:48,587 --> 00:52:49,849
What is it?

577
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:51,512
I swear, I'm fine.

578
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:53,988
We should be talking
about your wedding.

579
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:55,956
What's the matter?

580
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:00,454
My prince charming won't be the first.

581
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:02,993
What do you mean?

582
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:05,660
Bassam won't be my first man.

583
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:09,398
- He doesn't know?
- No, he doesn't.

584
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:14,410
Don't fuss, we'll kill two morning doves.

585
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:16,537
What are you talking about?

586
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:19,775
I've heard that if a girl has sinned...

587
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:23,284
...a little dove's blood
on the bridal sheet will do.

588
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:24,820
Why not sparrows?

589
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:27,720
Maybe it looks more real.

590
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:29,451
How do you trick the husband?

591
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,290
Well, the bride works it out.

592
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,829
It's like a challenge.

593
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:35,762
You and your crazy ideas.

594
00:53:35,901 --> 00:53:37,425
What do you suggest?

595
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:39,264
What happened?

596
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:55,375
Let's go, girls.
Back to your rooms, break's over.

597
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:57,988
Stop lazing around.

598
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,787
Souad Abdel-Sater?

599
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:03,121
Why not Abdel-Satan!

600
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,388
I don't understand.

601
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,929
Souad Abdel-Sater?

602
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:10,364
Where did you get that name?

603
00:54:10,936 --> 00:54:12,733
In the obituaries?

604
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:15,396
Couldn't you pick a Christian name?

605
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,407
Rita or Theresa, for example?

606
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:20,408
While we're at it...

607
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:22,536
...let's choose a French name.

608
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,546
Marie, Julie.

609
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:27,481
I can't be a "Marie" just once?

610
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:28,881
Yes, it would suit you.

611
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,547
What, you think you're going
to the Moulin Rouge or the Lido?

612
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:34,818
It's just a clinic.

613
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,951
Stop fussing.

614
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:40,221
You can hardly say "hi" in French.

615
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:42,356
You flunked it in high school.

616
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,967
I don't have to speak.

617
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:45,831
So you'd be a dumb French girl?

618
00:54:45,971 --> 00:54:48,371
What do you know?
I can speak French.

619
00:54:48,506 --> 00:54:51,964
My name is Julie. I'm from Paris.

620
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,044
I've come for a "hot" couture.

621
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:55,771
Shut up, he'll hear us.

622
00:54:55,914 --> 00:54:58,246
Okay, I'll shut up.

623
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:01,385
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning.

624
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:03,510
I'm going to the museum, please.

625
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:05,520
- Where?
- Museum.

626
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,249
Get in.

627
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:09,717
Good morning.

628
00:55:09,861 --> 00:55:11,852
But we're not going to the museum.

629
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:13,828
We'll take a shortcut.

630
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:16,593
Don't worry. I know the way.

631
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,503
Julie what?

632
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:23,903
- Pompidou.
- Pompidou?

633
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:32,314
For Dr. Stambouli?

634
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:35,610
Fourth...

635
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:39,181
...floor, lift is on your left.

636
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:42,957
Miss Pompidou...

637
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:46,757
...signature, please.

638
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,038
Two Stambouli stitches...

639
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,164
...and you'll be good as new.

640
00:55:59,978 --> 00:56:02,503
Like a teenager.

641
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:14,182
If Mr. Pompidou calls...

642
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:16,317
...tell him I am at the tailor's.

643
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:44,047
What are you listening to?

644
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:50,591
Your hair is beautiful.

645
00:56:51,496 --> 00:56:52,963
Thank you.

646
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:55,498
I like yours too, but...

647
00:56:56,368 --> 00:57:00,031
...short hair would suit you,
you have a beautiful face.

648
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,034
I wish.

649
00:57:03,174 --> 00:57:05,472
We could do it now.

650
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:09,679
Cut my hair?

651
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:12,146
They'd go mad at home.

652
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,990
Rima.

653
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:24,186
You've used up the hot water.

654
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:26,320
What now?

655
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:38,733
Oh, sorry.

656
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:42,971
I've come for...

657
00:57:43,148 --> 00:57:45,878
...the special...
The waxing offer.

658
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:47,507
I didn't quite understand.

659
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,951
Someone from your salon called me.
Isn't this salon Si Belle?

660
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:55,787
Yes, I called you.

661
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,589
- Your name?
- Christine Khoury.

662
00:57:59,764 --> 00:58:01,891
My appointment is for tomorrow.

663
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:04,433
But today is better.
Is it a problem?

664
00:58:04,569 --> 00:58:06,799
No, no problem.
What will it be?

665
00:58:06,938 --> 00:58:07,927
Waxing.

666
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:10,700
Layale.

667
00:58:11,576 --> 00:58:13,976
The lady's here for the special.

668
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:16,914
The waxing offer.

669
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:19,016
Hello.

670
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:21,848
This way, please.

671
00:59:15,907 --> 00:59:18,171
Sorry. It might be a bit hot.

672
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:22,245
Don't worry.
Maybe I'm oversensitive today.

673
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,270
Don't worry.

674
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:44,397
Your hair is so beautiful.

675
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,201
Thank you.

676
00:59:47,338 --> 00:59:51,365
I've always wanted to dye my hair black.

677
00:59:51,943 --> 00:59:53,672
Why don't you?

678
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,006
I'm thinking about it.

679
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:59,810
But my husband likes me the way I am.
I don't want to upset him.

680
00:59:59,951 --> 01:00:03,284
He doesn't like change.

681
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,427
Wait a second.

682
01:00:13,565 --> 01:00:15,658
Sorry.

683
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:18,198
It's okay.

684
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:22,101
What, should I have asked
for your permission before inviting her?

685
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,868
Stop being obsessed with her.

686
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:28,512
Did you see her ass?

687
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,174
Enormous. Relax.

688
01:00:31,316 --> 01:00:34,046
As for you, I'll cut your
tongue off if you mock me.

689
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:36,050
- I'm scared.
- Are you talking to me?

690
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:38,246
- Have you seen your ass?
- Shut up!

691
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:41,017
Thanks, you're so kind.

692
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:43,387
Aren't you tired?

693
01:00:43,528 --> 01:00:47,225
<i>Holy Mary, full of grace.</i>
<i>The Lord is with you.</i>

694
01:00:47,398 --> 01:00:48,888
<i>You are blessed amongst women.</i>

695
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:52,400
<i>And Jesus,</i>
<i>Blessed be the fruit of your womb.</i>

696
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:56,234
<i>- Hail Mary...</i>
<i>- Holy Mary.</i>

697
01:00:56,407 --> 01:00:59,934
<i>Mother of God,</i>
<i>Pray for us poor sinners.</i>

698
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:01,874
<i>Now and at the time of our death.</i>

699
01:01:02,013 --> 01:01:04,174
You're killing me.

700
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:08,417
- Once more.
- No, that's enough.

701
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,419
Our Lady won't forgive you.

702
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:15,083
Not at all.
Why won't she forgive me?

703
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:18,491
One more Hail Mary?

704
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,689
Two, if you want.

705
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:22,299
<i>Hail Mary...</i>

706
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:26,096
Father Constantin, pray for me!

707
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:30,196
I'll call the vicar,
I'll ask him to pray.

708
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:06,070
God give you health.

709
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:15,752
Hello!

710
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:19,449
Hello, young man.

711
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:23,919
Welcome.
We thought you'd never come.

712
01:02:24,095 --> 01:02:25,357
What a pleasure. Come in.

713
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:27,862
Thank you. Sorry...

714
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:30,432
Girls, let the gentleman through.

715
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:32,035
- Good morning.
- Come in, come in.

716
01:02:39,877 --> 01:02:42,903
Samia, can you give your place
to Mr. Handsome?

717
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:46,778
Of course.
Please, son. Sit down.

718
01:02:46,918 --> 01:02:50,149
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

719
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:57,859
Layale. We need you here.

720
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:02,696
What should we do to this lovely face?

721
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:18,281
The sideburns?

722
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,516
It won't hurt.

723
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,882
The moustache?

724
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:25,352
I'd say...

725
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:29,490
...a few hairs here and there.

726
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:31,492
Quickly, with the tweezers.

727
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:34,495
For the moustache, we'll see.

728
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:36,360
As for the eyebrows...

729
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:38,526
Absolutely.

730
01:03:41,706 --> 01:03:43,731
Heat the sugar, please.

731
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:52,115
Welcome.

732
01:03:53,985 --> 01:03:55,509
Thank you.

733
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:28,243
<i>Under your protection</i>

734
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:32,107
<i>We shelter, Holy Mary.</i>

735
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,961
Dear Rose,
Meet me for coffee at Doughan's...

736
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:23,089
...Tuesday at 5? Charles

737
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:38,806
Hello, Auntie Rose.

738
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,747
What a surprise.

739
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,546
What brings you here?

740
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:47,949
- What's up?
- She's got news.

741
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:50,287
I've come to fix my hair.

742
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:51,952
No!

743
01:06:52,096 --> 01:06:54,621
I don't believe it.

744
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,394
Rose finally came to fix her hair!

745
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:00,764
Let's pick the best color.

746
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:03,130
It's an honor.

747
01:07:03,307 --> 01:07:05,468
The best hairdo.
Where's the catalogue?

748
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:21,387
I told you, I have an audition.

749
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:27,263
I put on some makeup.
Had my hair done.

750
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:30,161
And my nails too.

751
01:07:30,601 --> 01:07:34,059
Of course I'm beautiful,
darling. I'm gorgeous.

752
01:07:37,742 --> 01:07:40,472
I'm waiting for my turn.

753
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:43,579
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you.

754
01:07:43,748 --> 01:07:45,215
Was I a bit shy?

755
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:48,341
Not at all. You were very good.

756
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:51,819
We'll call you soon. Okay? Bye-bye.

757
01:07:51,956 --> 01:07:54,083
- Hello, Jamale.
- Hi.

758
01:07:54,225 --> 01:07:56,420
How are you?
Where have you been?

759
01:07:57,228 --> 01:07:59,355
- Me?
- Show me.

760
01:07:59,497 --> 01:08:02,625
Your new color is lovely.

761
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:04,291
Hello, Rana. What's the matter?

762
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:08,763
Jamale!

763
01:08:08,906 --> 01:08:12,034
You've got blood on your skirt.

764
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,973
I can't believe it!

765
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:16,443
Girls, have you got a maxi pad?

766
01:08:28,592 --> 01:08:29,854
Come in, come in.

767
01:08:29,994 --> 01:08:32,724
Just a second, I'm coming.

768
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:01,550
Is everything ready for the wedding?

769
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,656
Everything's fine.

770
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:08,294
I've still got a small matter to sort out.

771
01:09:08,432 --> 01:09:12,198
But it will be alright, God willing.

772
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:03,911
Sarah, come here, darling.

773
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:40,323
Would you like something to drink?

774
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:43,051
No, thank you.

775
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:45,558
Red polish, like yours?

776
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:47,629
It's very nice on you.

777
01:10:47,798 --> 01:10:50,790
That depends on what you're wearing.

778
01:10:50,935 --> 01:10:52,402
A red dress.

779
01:10:52,803 --> 01:10:56,068
It's a surprise for my husband.
It's our wedding anniversary.

780
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:02,000
I've been running since this morning
to get everything ready...

781
01:11:02,146 --> 01:11:05,115
...without him even noticing.
I baked a cake.

782
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:07,480
I hope it'll be good. Normally...

783
01:11:07,651 --> 01:11:11,178
...my cakes are tasty.

784
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:14,781
Damn it! I forgot the balloons.

785
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:20,024
I'll ask my sister to buy some.

786
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:26,229
So family and friends will be there.

787
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,235
All the people he loves.

788
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:31,564
He should be happy, right?

789
01:11:33,844 --> 01:11:35,471
Something's bothering you?

790
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:37,944
No.

791
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:41,175
Are you okay?
Are you feeling alright?

792
01:11:44,154 --> 01:11:46,145
Here is your tip.

793
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,918
You deserve more.

794
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,048
No, thank you.

795
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:52,594
I insist.

796
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:46,241
How beautiful you are!

797
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,571
Darling, what are you doing?

798
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:50,373
You're going out?

799
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:53,176
Let me work a bit.

800
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:00,947
Work.

801
01:14:04,094 --> 01:14:06,892
Draw a nice moustache.

802
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:10,924
I know where you're going.

803
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:13,332
Go and wash your face, first.

804
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,596
Lili, that's enough!

805
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:18,333
He doesn't like women with makeup.

806
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:19,965
He likes my style.

807
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:23,905
That's enough, get out.

808
01:14:24,948 --> 01:14:27,883
Slow down, Rima.
The girl is sick.

809
01:14:28,018 --> 01:14:30,145
I drive as I damn well please.

810
01:14:30,287 --> 01:14:33,313
It's your mouth we should've sewn up.

811
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:36,423
I don't believe this.

812
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,894
You'd rather I drove into the potholes?

813
01:14:41,031 --> 01:14:44,398
You haven't missed a single one so far!

814
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:47,901
I just love listening to your complaints.

815
01:14:48,038 --> 01:14:51,371
- You wanted to sit in front!
- All I want is to arrive in one piece.

816
01:14:51,508 --> 01:14:54,102
Do you have an audition or not?

817
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,191
Open, dear.

818
01:15:44,761 --> 01:15:46,058
Rose.

819
01:15:47,097 --> 01:15:50,828
Open, so we can pray together.

820
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:54,870
I brought you some fish for dinner.

821
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:01,338
Are you coming?

822
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,341
Poor me.

823
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,780
I'm tired of this life!

824
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:20,753
Rosa.

825
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:24,492
My precious.

826
01:16:25,135 --> 01:16:27,865
You want to go to Manara?

827
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:31,304
Maybe I'll bury you there.

828
01:16:34,211 --> 01:16:37,738
Please, open.

829
01:16:38,949 --> 01:16:42,146
May God send you a nice husband.

830
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,412
I love you, Rose.

831
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:16,914
Why are you so stubborn?

832
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,147
Why?

833
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:21,590
Are you deaf?

834
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,717
Shall I take you to an ear doctor?

835
01:17:59,663 --> 01:18:02,860
What a mistake
to let you do this to me!

836
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:04,967
How can one trust women?
Are you nuts?

837
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,361
Pull the curtains, it's not a show.

838
01:18:08,505 --> 01:18:10,496
You think you're the main attraction?

839
01:18:10,674 --> 01:18:13,370
Why not razors?

840
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:17,571
One day, you'll miss having all that hair.

841
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:21,677
I'd like to see you in a skirt,
like a real girl.

842
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:25,219
You're always complaining. You can't
come to my wedding looking like this.

843
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:28,381
You have nice legs.
Why do you hide them?

844
01:18:28,558 --> 01:18:31,049
You want me to be like you?
Look at her.

845
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:33,424
I feel sorry for your husband.

846
01:18:33,997 --> 01:18:35,259
I'll deal with you later.

847
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:37,890
I can't take it anymore. Take it off.

848
01:18:38,201 --> 01:18:40,226
Two more minutes.

849
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:45,038
I like his voice more than yours, Rima.

850
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,508
Come on, darling,
get it out of your system.

851
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:30,385
When it comes to horns,
his horn is really special.

852
01:19:34,057 --> 01:19:35,581
Your taste.

853
01:19:35,726 --> 01:19:37,125
- What's wrong?
- This is naughty.

854
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,522
It's good for a bride.

855
01:19:39,596 --> 01:19:42,997
Mom, stop stuffing
everything in this suitcase.

856
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:45,532
Who would wear such old stuff?

857
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:49,798
As if I knew it would take you
ten years to get married.

858
01:19:49,973 --> 01:19:52,533
And besides, it's your
auntie who brought them.

859
01:19:52,676 --> 01:19:53,973
Then let her wear them.

860
01:20:01,618 --> 01:20:05,554
It's very nice.
Look in the mirror.

861
01:20:11,094 --> 01:20:13,585
Come on, Nisrine, hurry up.

862
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:15,629
I have something to tell you.

863
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:17,631
So you know what to expect.

864
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:20,430
You're no longer a child.

865
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:24,233
I did well in bringing you up.

866
01:20:24,374 --> 01:20:28,538
But this is your last night at home.

867
01:20:29,446 --> 01:20:31,641
This separation breaks my heart.

868
01:20:31,782 --> 01:20:35,616
Tomorrow, it'll be your night.
You know what this means.

869
01:20:35,786 --> 01:20:37,845
You go from one stage to another.

870
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:41,287
It will be the second stage of your life.

871
01:20:42,325 --> 01:20:44,316
All girls go through that.

872
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:46,326
I've been through it too.

873
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:49,261
You shouldn't be shy with him.

874
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:52,664
He's your husband, your prince.

875
01:20:52,803 --> 01:20:55,704
For better or for worse.

876
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:59,137
At first, it'll be difficult.
Then you'll get used to it.

877
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:02,439
Slowly, you'll get to know him.

878
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:06,139
That's life. Only God
knows what's in store.

879
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:08,547
It's like a melon.

880
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:11,483
You must cut it to see if it's good.

881
01:21:11,655 --> 01:21:14,681
God bless you.

882
01:21:14,825 --> 01:21:17,020
You'll always be my little girl.

883
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,823
Stop, Mom, you'll make me cry.

884
01:21:20,964 --> 01:21:22,226
Don't forget, my darling.

885
01:21:22,365 --> 01:21:23,559
- Don't cry.
- You're my life.

886
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,898
Our home will always be open for you.

887
01:21:28,038 --> 01:21:30,768
I'll always pray for you.

888
01:21:30,907 --> 01:21:32,772
- Let's go.
- Yes, love.

889
01:21:32,909 --> 01:21:36,572
- I don't want to see you cry.
- Alright, darling.

890
01:22:46,116 --> 01:22:48,710
Just a second.

891
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:51,919
Just a second.
Sorry for interrupting.

892
01:22:52,088 --> 01:22:55,251
I'd like to present a small gift...

893
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:56,984
...to the bride and the groom.

894
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:00,088
A modest gift.

895
01:23:00,997 --> 01:23:04,933
<i>I don 't care what people say</i>

896
01:23:05,602 --> 01:23:08,594
<i>Your name is my prayer</i>

897
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:12,606
<i>And fills me with Joy</i>

898
01:23:13,109 --> 01:23:19,878
<i>More beautiful than the earth, our love is</i>

899
01:23:20,483 --> 01:23:22,474
<i>They talk about love</i>

900
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:25,611
<i>When they talk about you</i>

901
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,152
<i>Love if you wish</i>

902
01:23:33,296 --> 01:23:36,163
<i>But love as they do...</i>

903
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:50,041
Are you in line for the bathroom?

904
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,169
Yes.

905
01:23:51,314 --> 01:23:54,112
May I go in before you?
I've got my period.

906
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,151
No, no. Okay?

907
01:24:29,886 --> 01:24:32,354
Come on, girls.

908
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:45,558
Ready?

909
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:53,874
One...

910
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:03,351
Two...

911
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:09,588
Three!

912
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:16,826
Look, it's a morning dove!

913
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,392
To my Beirut
